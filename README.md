# SoundBreak

SoundBreak is a macOS desktop application that automatically pauses and resumes music when detecting meeting applications. Built with Tauri + SvelteKit, it runs as a lightweight system tray application with real-time monitoring capabilities.

## Features

- üéµ **Universal Music Control**: Works with any music player through macOS MediaRemote framework
- üé§ **Smart Meeting Detection**: Configurable process-based detection for any meeting application
- üîÑ **Real-time Monitoring**: 2-second polling for instant response to meeting state changes
- üöÄ **Auto-start Support**: Optional launch on login with system integration
- üñ•Ô∏è **System Tray Integration**: Runs in background with live status indicators
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable Settings**: Customizable meeting app detection through exact process names
- üîí **Privacy-focused**: No network connections, all processing happens locally

## How It Works

1. **Meeting Detection**: Uses `pgrep` command to detect running meeting applications by exact process name matching
2. **Music Detection**: Leverages macOS MediaRemote framework to detect any music player's playback state
3. **Automatic Control**: When a meeting starts, automatically pauses music; resumes when meeting ends
4. **Background Operation**: Runs silently in the system tray with minimal resource usage

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Rust (Tauri v2) with native macOS APIs
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit + TypeScript + Vite
- **Build Tool**: Tauri CLI with pnpm
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - `tauri-plugin-autostart` for login integration
  - macOS MediaRemote framework for universal music control
  - Native `pgrep` for reliable process detection

## Installation

### Download & Install

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kfstorm/sound-break/releases)
2. Download the appropriate DMG file for your Mac:
   - `soundbreak-aarch64.dmg` for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
   - `soundbreak-x86_64.dmg` for Intel Macs

### macOS Security Notice

Since SoundBreak is not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS Gatekeeper will block it by default.

**If you see "SoundBreak is damaged and can't be opened":**

1. **Terminal Method (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   # Remove quarantine attribute
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/SoundBreak.app
   ```

2. **Right-click Method:**
   - Right-click the SoundBreak app ‚Üí "Open"
   - Click "Open" in the security dialog

3. **System Settings:**
   - Go to System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security
   - Look for SoundBreak and click "Open Anyway"

**Compatibility:** These methods work on macOS 15.4.1 and earlier. If you experience issues on newer macOS versions, building from source (see Development Setup below) creates a locally signed version.

**Why this happens:** macOS Gatekeeper blocks unsigned apps. SoundBreak is safe - you can verify by reviewing the open-source code.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) toolchain
- [Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)
- macOS development environment

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kfstorm/sound-break.git
cd sound-break

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Install Tauri CLI
pnpm add -g @tauri-apps/cli

# Development mode
pnpm tauri dev

# Build for production
pnpm tauri build
```

## Configuration

### Meeting Applications

SoundBreak comes with built-in support for:
- **Feishu Meetings** (Lark)
- **Tencent Meetings**

You can add additional meeting applications through the Settings menu by configuring their exact process names.

### Finding Process Names

To find the exact process name for your meeting application:

1. Start the meeting application
2. Open Terminal and run: `pgrep -l <partial_name>`
3. Use the exact process name shown in the output
4. Configure it in SoundBreak settings

### Auto-start Configuration

Enable auto-start through the system tray menu to have SoundBreak automatically launch when you log in to macOS.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **MonitoringService**: Central monitoring loop and state management
- **MeetingDetector**: Process-based meeting detection with exact name matching
- **MusicController**: Universal music control via MediaRemote framework
- **System Tray**: Real-time status updates and user controls

### Detection Methods

- **Meeting Detection**: Uses `pgrep ^process_name$` for exact process matching
- **Music Detection**: Accesses MediaRemote framework through AppleScript
- **State Management**: Mutex-protected shared state across background threads

## Privacy & Security

- **No Network Access**: All functionality is local to your machine
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requires accessibility permissions for process monitoring
- **No Data Collection**: No analytics, telemetry, or personal data is collected
- **Open Source**: Full source code is available for inspection

## System Requirements

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- Intel or Apple Silicon Mac
- Accessibility permissions for process monitoring

## Permissions

On first run, macOS will prompt for accessibility permissions. This is required for:

- Process monitoring to detect meeting applications
- System-level music control integration
